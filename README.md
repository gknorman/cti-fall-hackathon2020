Team 2's CTI Fall Hackathon Project for AdoptAClassroom.org - Timer that Rewards points to Students for staying focused

The following people are in the Team 2's CTI Fall Hackathon Project: Luke Lyu May Deng Boris Marin Geoffrey Norman

We learned that one of the problems with distance learning is that there is a lack of structure.  When school is in person, there are schedules and routines.  And that involves having structure.  When students are at home, they are having trouble with focusing.  Some students like the flexibility associated with distance learning.  However, students need structure and they need to know what is expected of them.  In addition, students need to be motivated to complete classwork and homework assignments.  

This project contains a visual timer and the visual timer will allow students to know how much time left for working on a classwork or homework assignment. The user inputs how much time the students will work, according to the appropriate grade level.  The web app indicates how much time the students were focused on the classwork or homework assignment.  Students earn points based on how many minutes they spent being focused on working on classwork or homework assignments.  Students can accumulate enough points in order to obtain the following possible options: stickers, movie time, game time, and virtual dance party.
